## Design

### Colour Scheme

I wanted tokeep the colour scheme for the site quite simple. My website features a black background with both saffron and white text. The idea behind this was to keep the website from being overwhelming but still elegant. 

* I have used #000000 for my background. 
* I have used #FFFFFF for text and some text backgrounds.
* I have used #E1BF01 for text and some text backgrounds.

![Hive Fitness colour scheme](documentation/colourscheme.png)

### Typography

Google Fonts was used to import the selected fonts for the site.

* For the headings, I have used the Google font [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?preview.text=Hive%20Fitness%20HIVE%20FITNESS%20-%20Roboto&preview.text_type=custom&query=roboto). While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid rhythm, Roboto doesn’t compromise, allowing letters to be settled into their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more commonly found in humanist and serif types.

![Roboto Font Example](documentation/roboto.png)

* For the body, I have used Google font [Quicksand](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Quicksand?preview.text=Hive%20Fitness%20HIVE%20FITNESS%20-%20Quicksand&preview.text_type=custom). QuickSand is a sans-serif font with clean, smooth lines. I’ve chosen a sans-serif font for the body text because studies show that sans-serif fonts tend to be more legible and easier to read on screens.

### Imagery

All images on the site were from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/)

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using balsamiq.

![Clubs Page](documentation/wireframes/clubswireframe.png)
![Members Page](documentation/wireframes/memberswireframe.png)
![Contact Page](documentation/wireframes/contactwireframe.png)

### Features

The website is made up of a home page, a clubs page, a members benefits page, a contact us page, a success page and a 4040 error page.

All page are responsive and have the below:

* A favicon in the browser tab.

![Favicon](documentation/favicon.png)

* The title/logo of the website on everypage. This also acts as a way to navigate back to the home page.

![Hive Fitness logo](documentation/hivefitnesslogo.png)

* Every page has a navigation bar in the header and footer. 

![Navigation Menus](documentation/header-nav-bar.png)

#### The Home Page

The home page of Hive Fitness displays a video of members working out at the gyms which would likely entice people to want to explore more of the website. 

![Home page hero video](documentation/indexherovideo.png)

As you scroll down the page, there is a motivational quote, two images to show off the gym and a contact us button which allows the user to seemlessly naviagte to the contact us page to get in touch.

![Content section of home page](documentation/indexcontent.png)

#### The Clubs Page

The clubs page displays in large text the amount of Hive Fitness gyms there are in the UK. The large text is symbolises that Hive is not a small business. 

Below that, there is a brief description and images of the largest cities that Hive Fitness has gyms in.

![The clubs page](documentation/clubspage.png)

#### The Members Benefits Page

The members page displays a hero image followed by a list of benefits each member would recieve if they were to join Hive Fitness. 

![Members page hero image and benefits](documentation/membershero.png)

The members page also displays all the amenities that Hive Fitness offer. The classes and personal training is highlighted first with larger images. That is followed by 3 smaller images highlighting the fuel bar, retail store and spa, all with brief desciptions.

![Members page amenities](documentation/memberscontent.png)

#### The Contact Us Page

The contact us page is where the user is able to engage with the most site the most. This page is used for the user to get in touch or leave feedback. The page contains text encourageing people to use the form on the page. The form has first name, last name, email, phone number, subject and message fields. All field are required to be filled with some form of text. The email field needs to be in email format with an '@'. The submit button below the form, submits the users information and navigates to the success page. 

! [The contact us page](documentation/contactpage.png)

#### The Success Page

The success page displays text indicating the information they submitted via the contact us form was successfully submitted. 

![The success page](documentation/successpage.png)

#### The 404 Error Page

The 404 error page displays text informing the user that there has been an error. Even though the user is unable to navigate to the page they want, the custom error page will improve their customer experience. 

![The 404 error page](Insert here) ******

#### Future Implementations

In the future, I would like to implement: 

1. Allow users to be able to purchase membership from the site.
2. A log in page to user to book personal training, classes and the gyms amenities. 
3. Create a back end database which will allow users to access workout routines and meal plans.
4. Explore ways to improve accessibility for people with color blindness.

### Accessibility

I have made a conscious effort during the coding process to ensure the website is highly accessible. I have achieved this by:

* I have used semantic HTML to improve acessibility and make the code more readable.
* I’ve implemented a hover state on all buttons to clearly indicate when a user is hovering over them.
* Choosing fonts that are easily readable and are suitable for dyslexia.
* Ensuring that the colours on the site do not clash, to improve user experience.
